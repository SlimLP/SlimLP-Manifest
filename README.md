SlimLP
================

Local Manifest to build SlimLP for the Huawei Y300 and G510

Build Instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Initialize repo using the SlimLP manifest (CAF branch)
    
		repo init -u git://github.com/SlimRoms/platform_manifest.git -b lp5.0-caf

2. Add my local manifest

		mkdir .repo/local_manifests
		Copy slimlp_huawei.xml to .repo/local_manifests

3. Then sync up the repositories

		repo sync

4. Initialize the build environment

		source build/envsetup.sh
    
5. Build the ROM

		For Y300:
			brunch u8833
		
		For G510:
			brunch u8951

NOTE:
   
   The JNI Generator [patch] included in android_device_huawei_msm7x27a-common is required for building the rom in my Arch Linux environment.
   For Ububtu based distros, this patch should not be needed to build the ROM so can be deleted.
